In a ruling dripping with derision, a federal judge has rejected President Trump's defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, asserting that the rambling 85-page suit did not follow federal rules for filing civil complaints.

The president's team has been given a month to refile, and a Trump spokesperson indicated that they will do so.

Judge Steven D. Merryday of the US District Court for the Middle District of Florida said Friday that the suit "stands unmistakably and inexcusably athwart the requirements of Rule 8" of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

A complaint must be a "short, plain, direct statement of allegations of fact," he wrote, and Trump's broadside against The Times was "decidedly improper and impermissible."
